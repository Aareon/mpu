   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to mpu's documentation!
===============================


This package contains various small functions and classes. All of the
functionality is not offered by any mayor package.

Core design principles are:

* **Lightweight**: mpu does not bring unexpected dependencies. You have
  fine-grained control via extras.
* **Documentation**: Every parameter is properly documented. For each opened
  issue or question I will think about adding the information to the docs
* **Testing**: >90% test coverage. For each issue found I will think about
  creating a test which could have shown the issue.

Please note that this is not in version 1.0 yet. So there will likely be
breaking changes.
